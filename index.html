    <p>Crawling out of the depths of some black lagoon, I witnessed this world and found it to be suitable for habitation. Shedding damp seawood and prying barnacles from my scales, I searched for the machinations that made this planet tick. Low and behold, computer technologies seemed to rule the life of many humans on this planet. What are the languages that govern these machines? I had to obtain the keys to this knowledge. I had to find the nearest Microcenter and purchase the device known as a "laptop".</p>
