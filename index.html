    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p id="mainSectionContent">Crawling out of the depths of some black lagoon, I witnessed this world and found it to be suitable for habitation. Shedding damp seawood and prying barnacles from my scales, I searched for the machinations that made this planet tick.

I had to find the nearest Microcenter and purchase the device known as a "laptop".</p>
