                <p><img id="profilePicture" src="assets/images/Testprofilepic.jpg" style="width:300px;height:200px;float:left;">Crawling out of the depths of some black lagoon, I witnessed this world and found it to be suitable for habitation. Shedding damp seawood and prying barnacles from my scales, I searched for the machinations that made this planet tick. Low and behold, computer technologies seemed to rule the life of many humans on this planet. What are the languages that govern these machines? I had to obtain the keys to this knowledge. I had to find the nearest Microcenter and purchase the device known as a "laptop".</p>

                <p2>Alright is that creative enough? Mountain dew or crab juice? More nonsense for everyone right here. Yea boys, it's still rolling on. Pinapple upside down cake. Cherry crepes. Maple cookies. Blueberry tarlets. Sticky toffee pudding. Pistacio ice cream. Chocolate chip waffles. Peach cobbler. Raspberry lemon smoothie. Banana cream pie. Pumpkin pancakes. Root beer float. Peanut butter cookies.
